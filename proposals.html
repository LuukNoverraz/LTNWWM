                    <h2><a href="proposals.html">Proposals</a></h2>
                    <p>Not just scientists have thrown their hat in the ring when it comes to the matter of storing nuclear waste.
                    Cultural research has resulted in a multitude of proposals from people of all fields. Some of the more intriguing ones
                    are catalogued here.</p>

                    <p>The German magazine <em>Zeitschrift für Semiotik</em> issued polls in 1982 and 1983 asking:
                    <q>How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?</q>
                    leading to some of the following proposals.</p>

                    <h3>Atomic Priesthood</h3>
                    <p>Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed the creation of an "atomic priesthood", a pseudoreligion of sorts
                    consisting of experts that were to artifically create rituals and myths to preserve information about radioactive areas.
                    The priesthood would indicate which areas were off-limits and what would happen were you not to listen.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Because this proposal introduces the creation of new hierarchies, which could lead to political struggle and the witholding of information
                    to a privileged class, the idea has not been taken seriously beyond the artistic sphere.</p>

                    <h3>Ray Cats</h3>
                    <p>Author Françoise Bastide and semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed breeding <q>radiation cats</q> or <q>ray cats</q>.
                    The radiation cats would undergo a significant color change when exposed to radioactive emissions, thus serving as danger indicators.
                    To keep the danger of radioactive cats in the collective human awareness, its significance would have to be carried down through tales and myths
                    transmitted through e.g. poetry and music.</p>

                    <p>Though radioactive cats are not exactly a trend within music, at least one song has been written about them. Emperor X wrote the following song to be
                    <q>so catchy and annoying that it might be handed down from generation to generation over a span of 10,000 years</q>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Information Plants</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stanisław Lem, Polish science-fiction author proposed a biological coding of DNA to create <q>information plants</q>.
                        The DNA of these plants would then contain data about the storage locations and their contents.
                        The plants would grow only near the storage sites and would inform humans about the dangers of radioactive waste.
                        Lem himself acknowledged the major flaw in this plan, namely that humans would likely not know the meaning of the so-called
                        information plants 10,000 years in the future, so they would most likely serve no purpose.
